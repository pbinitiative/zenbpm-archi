The architecture for ZenBPM, documented in [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/)

### Usage

1. Install Archi itself
2. Install plugin [coArchi â€“ Model Collaboration for Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins/)
3. Open Archi
3.1. configure Git access, via `open preferences` -> navigate to `Collaboration` and ensure your Git credentials do work
4. Go to menu `Collaboration` -> `Import Remote Model to workspace` -> enter the repository URL like you would use for cloning e.g. `https://github.com/pbinitiative/zenbpm-archi.git`
5. Hint: at this moment, no errors should happen but your screen might remain empty.
   You need to open the View/Window called `Collaboration`, there you find an entry, indicating you're on the `[Master]` branch. Then you can right-click `Open Model` on this entry.
   Sometimes the View/Window `Models` is not visible and you might need to toggle it on.
   (PS: the user experience is very manual at this point)
